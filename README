Google Invisibility Half Scan

Description:
Find out if your (Gtalk) buddies are Invisible. To do that it sends a presence 
probe to the buddy. If there’s no respose before time out expires), then you can
establish that the buddy have not active resources (and therefore it should be 
OFFLINE). If you get a presence of type ‘unavailable’ means that the buddy has 
at least an active resource (but we can’t know what! It could be a Gmail or 
iGoogle page opened with chat turned off!) and therefore COULD be Invisible (at 
least you know he or she is connected).

*** UPDATE ***
I’ve added the possibility to filter passive online Google clients (such as 
Gmail, iGoogle and Google Talk Lab Edition). This clients, when the chat is 
disabled, send a presence with a vcard if the shared status is not invisible. A 
mere unavailable presence if shared status is invisible. See [2] for more 
information.

NOTE:

o - This is an “HALF SCAN” because you can not establish with certainty that a 
    buddy is invisible (read Description).
    
o - This plugin works only with Gmail address with domain gmail.com. know that I
    could use Google Talk flag to get all Gmail accounts but this is not 
    possible in Debian by using only pidgin-dev dependencies. If you know a 
    better way to do this please contact me!

How to install:
Read the INSTALL file.

How to use:
1)  Compile and Install (read INSTALL) or Download (from 
    http://www.siorarina.net/google-invisibility-half-scan/) the plugin for your
    arch.

    Linux: if you don't have GNU make program installed on your system, to 
    install the plugin manually copy google-invisibility-half-scan.so in your 
    purple home dir:
    
    (if ~/.purple/plugins/ does not exist: $ mkdir ~/.purple/plugins/ )
    $ cp google-invisibility-half-scan.so ~/.purple/plugins/

    Windows: Move google-invisibility-half-scan.dll in Pidgin plugins dir (I 
    suppose you can create 
    C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Applications data\.purple\plugins 
    and move the plugin there). In Windows it should be something like 
    C:\Programmi\Pidgin\plugins\

3)  Restart Pidgin and in Tools/Plugins you should see Google Invisibility Half 
    Scan Plugin

    Once enabled, there’are two things you can do with this plugin:

    o - open the context menu by right clicking on a buddy and select “Is it 
        Invisible?” and wait the response.
        
    o - open Tools\Google Invisibility Half Scan Plugin\Massive scan… and wait 
        the response. You can set timeout values in Tools\Plugin, select Google 
        Invisibility Half Scan Plugin and then Configure.

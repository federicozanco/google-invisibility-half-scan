Date        Version Note

19/01/2011  0.2.1   Nothing new but I've add a Makefile to make compiling easier
                    and more efficient. Now unused dependencies like gtk are no
                    more needed (Finch users should be happy!)

17/07/2010  0.2     Added possibility to filter Gmail, Gtalk, iGoogle page with 
                    chat disabled. Weâ€™re sure that shared status of those 
                    buddies is not invisible
                    
12/06/2010  0.1     First
